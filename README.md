# Convinced Coder source files

This repository contains the Jekyll source files for my blog https://convincedcoder.github.io/. I am generating the actual site myself and hosting it on GitHub pages through the repository at https://github.com/convincedcoder/convincedcoder.github.io.

I have started this repository as a fork of [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and made my own changes to the design and behavior of the blog.
