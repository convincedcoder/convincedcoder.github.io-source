# The Human Microphone source files

This repository contains the Jekyll source files for my blog https://thehumanmicrophone.github.io/.

I have started this repository as a fork of [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and made my own changes to the design and behavior of the blog.
