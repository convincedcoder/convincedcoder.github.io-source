Hi, I am Maarten Michiels and this is my blog. I intend to cover a wide variety of topics related to software development in general and Java and JavaScript in particular.

I put links to my newly published posts on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/convincedcoder). The source files for this blog can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/convincedcoder/convincedcoder.github.io-source).
