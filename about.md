This blog will cover a wide variety of software development topics with a focus on Java and Javascript.

In case you're wondering where the name "The Human Microphone" comes from: it's one of the many nicknames I received because of my particular physical appearance and I couldn't think of something less silly to use as the name for this blog.

If you think I made a mistake somewhere or forgot to take something important into account, feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thehumanmicrop1) or create an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/thehumanmicrophone/thehumanmicrophone.github.io-source) for this blog's source files.
