Hi, I am Maarten Michiels and this is my blog. I intend to cover topics related to general software development, Java and JavaScript.

If you think I made a major mistake somewhere or forgot to take something important into account, feel free to reach out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/convincedcoder) or create an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/convincedcoder/convincedcoder.github.io-source) for this blog's source files.
